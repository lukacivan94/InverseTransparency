  * .../css/pluginStyle.css                -- Define CSS styles
  * .../gadgets/ethical-plugin/gadget.xml  -- Create the HTML structure
  * .../js/dashboardPlugin.js              -- Program the logic with JavaScript

Files that you might look at:

* src/main/resources...
  * .../atlassian-plugin.xml               -- Defines which files are to be imported
  * .../dashboardPlugins.properties        -- Defines the plugin name and description

Search for "[ETHICAL_SSE]" in these files to find starting points for you.

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

To rebuild during a run, open a second terminal and run:

* atlas-mvn package -- Quick Reload running plugin
